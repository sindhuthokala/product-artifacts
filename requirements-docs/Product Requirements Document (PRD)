## Customer360 Intelligent Insights Platform – Phase 1

### 1. Overview

Customer360 Intelligent Insights Platform is a data and AI-powered ecosystem that unifies customer data from multiple sources into a single, actionable view. It enables analytics, segmentation, and activation across channels, supporting smarter decision-making and personalized experiences.

Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core data foundation: ingesting data from key systems, unifying identities, and enabling basic analytics and segmentation.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

Customer data is currently fragmented across web analytics, CRM, transactional systems, and marketing platforms. This leads to:

- Inconsistent customer views across teams  
- Difficulty measuring engagement and retention  
- Limited personalization and targeting capabilities  
- Manual, error-prone reporting and decision-making  

The organization needs a unified, reliable Customer360 view to power analytics, activation, and AI use-cases.

### 3. Objectives & Success Metrics

**Objectives (Phase 1)**  
- Create a unified customer profile that aggregates data from at least 3 core systems  
- Enable basic churn-risk and engagement analytics  
- Provide a foundation for future AI models and real-time use-cases  

**Success Metrics**  
- ≥ 80% of active customers represented as unified profiles  
- ≥ 90% success rate for daily data ingestion jobs  
- At least 3 high-value segments available for analytics/activation (e.g., “High value / at risk”, “New customers”, “Dormant users”)  

---

### 4. Scope

**In Scope (Phase 1)**  
- Data ingestion from 3 core sources (e.g., CRM, web events, transactions)  
- Identity resolution rules (email + customer ID + device ID, where available)  
- Core profile schema definition (demographics, lifecycle, engagement signals)  
- Basic analytics views / tables for Customer360 reporting  
- Initial dashboards for customer overview & retention metrics  

**Out of Scope (Phase 1)**  
- Real-time decisioning and streaming personalization  
- Complex journey orchestration  
- Full marketing automation build-out  
- Deep predictive modeling beyond simple churn/engagement prototypes  

---

### 5. Users & Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**
  - Marketing team (targeting & segmentation)
  - Analytics / BI team (reporting & insight generation)
  - Product managers (feature usage and retention insights)

- **Key Stakeholders**
  - Product Owner, Customer360
  - CDP / Data Architect
  - Data Engineering Lead
  - AI / Data Science Lead
  - Marketing Operations Lead
  - Compliance / Security Representative

---

### 6. High-Level Features (Phase 1)

1. **Unified Customer Profile**
   - Aggregated attributes from CRM, web, and transaction systems  
   - Base identity graph (per user)  

2. **Data Ingestion Pipelines**
   - Scheduled ingestion jobs (batch)  
   - Monitoring & basic error handling  

3. **Analytics & Reporting Views**
   - Tables/views designed for BI tools (Power BI / Looker)  
   - Retention and engagement metric support  

4. **Segmentation Capability**
   - Basic rules-based segments (e.g., “active last 30 days”, “no activity 90 days”)  

5. **Governance & Access Control**
   - Role-based access to PII  
   - Clear data ownership across teams  

---

### 7. User Stories (Samples)

- **As a marketing manager**, I want to see unified profiles with engagement and purchase history so that I can build better segments.  
- **As a data analyst**, I want consistent Customer360 tables I can query for dashboards without manually joining multiple systems.  
- **As a product manager**, I want to understand retention and churn signals so I can prioritize product improvements.  

---

### 8. Acceptance Criteria (Examples)

| ID  | Given | When | Then |
|-----|-------|------|------|
| AC1 | A customer exists in CRM and transaction systems | Data pipelines run | A unified profile exists for that customer |
| AC2 | A data ingestion job completes | Monitoring runs | Success/failure status is logged and accessible |
| AC3 | A BI analyst queries the Customer360 view | Query filters by date range and segment | Results return within agreed SLA |
| AC4 | A user requests access to PII tables | They do not have the proper role | Access is denied and logged |

---

### 9. Risks & Assumptions

**Risks**  
- Inconsistent identifiers across systems may reduce profile stitching accuracy  
- Poor data quality in source systems may impact analytics  
- Scope creep into advanced personalization may delay core foundation work  

**Assumptions**  
- Source systems can provide data via exports or APIs on a regular schedule  
- The organization has (or will have) a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake / BigQuery)  
- Stakeholders are available for requirements clarification and validation
